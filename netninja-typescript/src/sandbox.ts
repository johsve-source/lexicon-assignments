let character: string = 'mario';
let age: number = 30;
let isBlackBelt: boolean = false;

// Since you've declared the type to specific types, you can't reassign the variables to any other type than the one specified.
// character = 20; -> Error
character = 'luigi'; // This works since it's a string.
